Myself, and a couple of my friends, worked together on a project at a hackathon in late 2019. We put together a website designed to let you place pins with comments onto a map, designed in such a way that you can plot your memories and share them with the world. We won an award at the hackathon for it, and we doucmented some information and screenshots on [DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/memory-lane-g43a72).
