Hi! I'm Callum, a 21 year old student based in London. My primary areas of interest include Cybersecurity, Software Development and . I try to take on as many opportunities as possible to learn and experience new things, and have a healthy mix of successess and failures from doing so. I'm GCIH and GCFE certified, have a solid working knowledge of Python and Javascript; alongside a basic understanding of many more programming languages, and try to do my best when presented with a challenge!

If you have any opportunities that you think I'd be a great fit for, please [send me an email](mailto:callum@callumfraser.me)!

## Education

### Academic

I'm currently in the third year of a MSci Computer Science course at King's College London, on track for a First Class degree.

In the past, I achieved `A*AB` in A-Level examinations in Maths, Physics and Further Maths, and 9 `A*-A` (9-7), 10 `A*-C` (9-5) at GCSE level.

### Professional

I've had the opportunity, over the years, to also participate in some training courses and earn some certifications, both through merit-based opportunities and free promotions. These include the FOR500 and SEC504 training courses provided by the SANS institute.

As a result, I'm currently [GCIH and GCFE certified](https://www.giac.org/certified-professional/Callum-Fraser/183656); and am an member of the GIAC Advisory Board. I haven't yet had the opportunity to put these skills to direct use in a professional setting, but look forward to doing so soon.

## Accolades

I've participated in various competitions and contests over time, and had my fair share of successes and failures.

I was one of the first to complete the [BLKBOX challenge](https://blkbox.hmgcc.gov.uk/) put together by HMGCC.

I was also a member of the winning team at a Cyber Security Challenge F2F in 2018, and as a result was invited to their Masterclass that year, at which [I was also on the winning team](https://cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/press-releases/top-young-british-cyber-talent-crowned-champion-of-the-cryptofactor).

I attended Cyber Discovery Elite for 3 years, from 2018-2020, which involved being one of the top 2% of participants in the program, gaining certifications as mentioned above.
## Employment

While not currently employed, I've taken on a few employment opportunities over time, although am yet to experience any permanent full-time positions.

Most recently, I've completed two 8-week summer placements over the last two years of my degree, mainly revolving around developing software to be used to aid a SOC.

I do also do some casual work, including as a Widing Participation Ambassador for my University.
When I was younger, I also did some part-time work at Legoland Windsor, to gain some experience of the workplace while still in 6th form.

## Volunteering

I also enjoy volunteering in various capacities, when given the chance.
Currently, I'm the Society President for [KCL Cyber Security Society](https://kclcybersociety.org/), running regular sessions with presentations of Cyber Security topics and helping organise initiatives and events.

During Early-Mid 2021, I also volunteered at COVID-19 Vaccination Centers in London for a couple of hours each week, helping register and guide members of the public around the centre.
