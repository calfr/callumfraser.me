Hi! I'm Callum, and I'm currently a 2nd year Computer Science student studying in London.

## Interests

### Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a subject area that really interests me. Small details about how different systems work draw my interest, and the security of an overall system can rely heavily on these things.

I've had some opportunities to demonstrate my skills too - I was invited to attend the [Cyber Security Challenge Masterclass](https://www.cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/press-releases/top-young-british-cyber-talent-crowned-champion-of-the-cryptofactor) back in 2018, where I was a member of the winning team.
I was also invited to various Cyber Discovery Elite events between 2018 and 2020, through which I was able to gain [GCIH](https://www.giac.org/certification/certified-incident-handler-gcih) and [GCFE](https://www.giac.org/certification/certified-forensic-examiner-gcfe) certifications after taking a training course and passing an examination.

### Software Dev

I spend some of my spare time working on other software development projects outside assignments and without as much focus on the Cybersecurity side of things. These might be part of Hackathons, projects for organisations, or just cool things I feel like working on!

I try to keep an ongoing [list of projects](/projects) on this website, which will only grow as time passes!

## Hobbies

### Gaming

I spend some of my spare time (probably too much!) playing various videogames. Right now, I'm enjoying playing [Destiny 2](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/NewLight), although I try other things too here and there.
