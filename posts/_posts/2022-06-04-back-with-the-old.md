Hello, again!
Just a quick update to say I've decided to go back to the old website design somewhat, but with a good handful
of improvements!

One of the main reasons for this is that the previous version used a design that was almost entirely from a template.
While templates are useful for starting quickly, they have a more generic feel and don't offer as much of an opportunity
to demonstrate my own skills. 

As a result, I'm returning to the self-designed format - so please bare with me if some 
things need polish!

Although I don't write these posts much, I still wanted a place to put them. As a result, I've added a posts section, 
which you're likely viewing right now, where I can make these posts.
For the rest of the information, I've returned it to a one page format.

I'm also dogfooding my element-encrypt tool by utilising it as a means of obfuscating email addresses on this website - 
recently I've been recieving more and more spam in my inbox so hopefully this can help mitigate that!

Expect more posts at some point - but otherwise, welcome back to the site!
